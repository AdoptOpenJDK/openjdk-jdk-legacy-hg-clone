Name of the input file, which can be a \f[CB]pack200\ gzip\f[R] file or a
\f[CB]pack200\f[R] file.
The input can also be a JAR file produced by \f[CB]pack200\f[R] with an
effort of \f[CB]0\f[R], in which case the contents of the input file are
copied to the output JAR file with the \f[CB]pack200\f[R] marker.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[CB]unpack200\f[R] command is a native implementation that
transforms a packed file produced by the \f[CB]pack200\f[R] into a JAR
file for web deployment.
An example of typical usage follows.
In the following example, the \f[CB]myarchive.jar\f[R] file is produced
from \f[CB]myarchive.pack.gz\f[R] with the default \f[CB]unpack200\f[R]
command settings.

.SH OPTIONS FOR THE UNPACK200 COMMAND
.TP
.B \f[CB]\-H\f[R]\f[I]value\f[R] or \f[CB]\-\-deflate\-hint=\f[R]\f[I]value\f[R]
Sets the deflation to be \f[CB]true\f[R], \f[CB]false\f[R], or \f[CB]keep\f[R]
on all entries within a JAR file.
The default mode is \f[CB]keep\f[R].
If the value is \f[CB]true\f[R] or \f[CB]false\f[R], then the
\f[CB]\-\-deflate=hint\f[R] option overrides the default behavior and sets
the deflation mode on all entries within the output JAR file.
