   * Notes:
   *
   *  a. It is important to have byte_offset and word_offset return constant
   *     expressions, because that will allow to constant-fold forwarding ptr
   *     accesses. This is not a problem in JIT compilers that would generate
   *     the code once, but it is problematic in GC hotpath code.
   *
   *  b. With filler object mechanics, we may need to allocate more space for
   *     the forwarding ptr to meet alignment requirements for objects. This
   *     means *_offset and *_size calls are NOT interchangeable. The accesses
   *     to forwarding ptrs should always be via *_offset. Storage size
   *     calculations should always be via *_size.
